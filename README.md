Developed a sorting game using efficient algorithms to sort different ranges of numbers in a stack, which provided an opportunity to enhance my coding skills and develop a deeper understanding of algorithm optimization. The game involved sorting a stack of numbers using a limited number of sorting moves, which required me to design an algorithm that optimized sorting efficiency while minimizing the number of moves. This project honed my skills in problem-solving, algorithm design, and optimization techniques.
